Writing this text to log file [ version3.log ]
Analysis started: Thu Apr 23 23:20:58 2020

Options in effect:
	--bfile cesio
	--cluster
	--K 2
	--out version3

Reading map (extended format) from [ cesio.bim ] 
10614 markers to be included from [ cesio.bim ]
Reading pedigree information from [ cesio.fam ] 
50 individuals read from [ cesio.fam ] 
50 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
20 cases, 30 controls and 0 missing
25 males, 25 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Reading genotype bitfile from [ cesio.bed ] 
Detected that binary PED file is v1.00 SNP-major mode
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 10614 SNPs
0 founders and 50 non-founders found
10614 SNPs with no founder genotypes observed
Warning, MAF set to 0 for these SNPs (see --nonfounders)
Writing list of these SNPs to [ version3.nof ]
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 1
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 10614 SNPs
After filtering, 20 cases, 30 controls and 0 missing
After filtering, 25 males, 25 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Converting data to Individual-major format
Clustering individuals based on genome-wide IBS
Merge distance p-value constraint = 0
Of these, 1225 are pairable based on constraints
Writing cluster progress to [ version3.cluster0 ]
Writing cluster solution (1) [ version3.cluster1 ]
Writing cluster solution (2) [ version3.cluster2 ]
Writing cluster solution (3) [ version3.cluster3 ]
