Reading map (extended format) from [ prunedcesio.bim ] 
10614 markers to be included from [ prunedcesio.bim ]
Reading pedigree information from [ prunedcesio.fam ] 
50 individuals read from [ prunedcesio.fam ] 
50 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
20 cases, 30 controls and 0 missing
25 males, 25 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Reading genotype bitfile from [ prunedcesio.bed ] 
Detected that binary PED file is v1.00 SNP-major mode
Using merge mode 1 : consensus call (default)

10614 markers to be merged from [ prunedcesio.bim ]
Of these, 0 are new, 10614 already exist in current data
50 individuals merged from [ prunedcesio.fam ] 
Of these, 0 were new, 50 were already in current data

Detected that binary PED file is v1.00 SNP-major mode
50 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
20 cases and 30 controls
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 10614 SNPs
0 founders and 50 non-founders found
10614 SNPs with no founder genotypes observed
Warning, MAF set to 0 for these SNPs (see --nonfounders)
Writing list of these SNPs to [ pruned.merge.cesio.nof ]
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 1
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 10614 SNPs
After filtering, 20 cases, 30 controls and 0 missing
After filtering, 25 males, 25 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
