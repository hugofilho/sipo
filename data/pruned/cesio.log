Options in effect:
	--file cesio
	--make-bed
	--out cesio

10614 (of 10614) markers to be included from [ cesio.map ]
50 individuals read from [ cesio.ped ] 
50 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
20 cases, 30 controls and 0 missing
25 males, 25 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 10614 SNPs
0 founders and 50 non-founders found
10614 SNPs with no founder genotypes observed
Warning, MAF set to 0 for these SNPs (see --nonfounders)
Writing list of these SNPs to [ cesio.nof ]
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 1
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 10614 SNPs
After filtering, 20 cases, 30 controls and 0 missing
After filtering, 25 males, 25 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Writing pedigree information to [ cesio.fam ] 
Writing map (extended format) information to [ cesio.bim ] 
Writing genotype bitfile to [ cesio.bed ] 
Using (default) SNP-major mode
