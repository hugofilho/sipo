Reading map (extended format) from [ cesio.bim ] 
2789 markers to be included from [ cesio.bim ]
Reading pedigree information from [ cesio.fam ] 
50 individuals read from [ cesio.fam ] 
50 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
20 cases, 30 controls and 0 missing
25 males, 25 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Reading genotype bitfile from [ cesio.bed ] 
Detected that binary PED file is v1.00 SNP-major mode
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 2789 SNPs
0 founders and 50 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 1
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 2789 SNPs
After filtering, 20 cases, 30 controls and 0 missing
After filtering, 25 males, 25 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
