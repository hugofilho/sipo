Analysis started: Thu Apr 23 17:23:50 2020

Options in effect:
	--bfile cesio
	--cluster
	--cc
	--ppc 0.01
	--out version2

Reading map (extended format) from [ cesio.bim ] 
2789 markers to be included from [ cesio.bim ]
Reading pedigree information from [ cesio.fam ] 
50 individuals read from [ cesio.fam ] 
50 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
20 cases, 30 controls and 0 missing
25 males, 25 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Reading genotype bitfile from [ cesio.bed ] 
Detected that binary PED file is v1.00 SNP-major mode
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 2789 SNPs
0 founders and 50 non-founders found
2789 SNPs with no founder genotypes observed
Warning, MAF set to 0 for these SNPs (see --nonfounders)
Writing list of these SNPs to [ version2.nof ]
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 1
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 2789 SNPs
After filtering, 20 cases, 30 controls and 0 missing
After filtering, 25 males, 25 females, and 0 of unspecified sex

 **Warning** this analysis typically requires whole-genome level data
             to give accurate results 

Converting data to Individual-major format
Clustering individuals based on genome-wide IBS
Merge distance p-value constraint = 0.01
Of these, 1222 are pairable based on constraints
Writing cluster progress to [ version2.cluster0 ]
Writing cluster solution (1) [ version2.cluster1 ]
Writing cluster solution (2) [ version2.cluster2 ]
Writing cluster solution (3) [ version2.cluster3 ]
