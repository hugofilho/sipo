Analysis started: Thu Apr 23 17:25:40 2020

Options in effect:
	--bfile cesio
	--mh
	--adjust
	--out aac3

Reading map (extended format) from [ cesio.bim ] 
2789 markers to be included from [ cesio.bim ]
Reading pedigree information from [ cesio.fam ] 
50 individuals read from [ cesio.fam ] 
50 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
20 cases, 30 controls and 0 missing
25 males, 25 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Reading genotype bitfile from [ cesio.bed ] 
Detected that binary PED file is v1.00 SNP-major mode
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 2789 SNPs
0 founders and 50 non-founders found
2789 SNPs with no founder genotypes observed
Warning, MAF set to 0 for these SNPs (see --nonfounders)
Writing list of these SNPs to [ aac3.nof ]
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 1
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 2789 SNPs
After filtering, 20 cases, 30 controls and 0 missing
After filtering, 25 males, 25 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel 2x2xK test, K = 1
Writing results to [ aac3.cmh ]
Computing corrected significance values (FDR, Sidak, etc)
Genomic inflation factor (based on median chi-squared) is 1.15206
Mean chi-squared statistic is 1.06912
Correcting for 781 tests
Writing multiple-test corrected significance values to [ aac3.cmh.adjusted ]
